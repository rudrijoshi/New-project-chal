# Regex Tutorial - Match an HTML Tag

Introductory paragraph (replace this with your text)

## Summary

The tutorial is going to describe the usage of regex in order to match the HTML tags with the help of the expression /^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$/. This is can be tremendously useful when working with HTML as it allows a user to find and modify attributes or specific tags inside an HTML document.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

In this regex for matching an HTML tags, the anchors are characters ^ which signifies a string that begins with the characters that accompany it and $ character signifies that a string ends with the character that leads upto it.

### Quantifiers

In this regex for matching an HTML tags, the quantifiers are + which means that it matches one or mthat ore lowercase letters and that allows the regex to match HTML tags that consist of one or more lowercase letters. Moreover, there is an asterisk(*) which is also a quantifier means that the captured group `([^<]+)` can occur zero or more times and that allows the regex to capture any additional content or attributes that may show inside the HTML tag.

### Grouping Constructs

Grouping construct in this regex is `([a-z]+)` which captures one or more lowercase letter that is used to capture the tag name. Additionally, `([^<]+)*` is also a grouping construct which captures any characters that are not `<` (additional content or the tag attributes) and that allows the occurence to be zero or more times. Moreover, `?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)` is also a grouping construct which is a non-capturing group indicated by `(?:...)` and it has two alternatives which are separated by `|`. In the initial alternative `>(.*)<\/\1>`, `(.*)` indicates any characters between `>` and `</tagname>`. The `<\/\1>` which makesure that the close tag is matching with the open tag catch by the first group. Basically , this alternative `>(.*)<\/\1>`captures the content within the opening and closing tags. Another alternative `\s+\/>` captures a tag that closes itself where `\s+` matches one or more whitespace characters accompanied by `/>`.


### Character Classes

As mentioned above in the first grouping construct `([a-z]+)`, the character class `[a-z]` matches any lowercase letter from a to z and `+` after the character class determines that one or more lowercase letters should be matched. Another grouping construct `([^<]+)`, the character class `[^<]` matches any character that is not a `<` symbol. It is used to catch the additional content or the attributes as long as it does not contain the `<` symbol within the HTML tag.

### The OR Operator

In this regex for matching an HTML tags, the OR operator is `>(.*)<\/\1>` which matches the open and close tags with the content inside the tags and thsi pattern is used when there is a close tags. Another OR opertor is `\s+\/>` which matches a self-closing tag without any content between the open and close tags.


### Character Escapes

`\/` is a character escape which matches a forward slash (`/`) and taht is used in the close tag pattern `<\/\1>` to match the literal `</` accompanied by the captured tag name (`\1`) and then teh closing angle bracket (`>`). `\s` is a character escape which matches any whitespace characters including tabs, spaces and line breaks. This is used in thsi alternative `\s+\/>` which matches one or more whitespace characters before the self-closing tag pattern which is `/>`.
